# Sentiment-analysis

Sentiment analysis also known as opinion mining is a subfield within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that builds machine learning algorithms to classify a text according to the sentimental polarities of opinions it contains, e.g., positive or negative. In recent year, sentiment analysis has become a topic of great interest and development in both academics and industry. An automatic sentiment classification system can not only help companies grasp the satisfaction level of the products, but also significantly assist new customers to locate their online shopping shelves.

In this project, the aim is to develop an automatic sentiment classification system that relies on machine learning techniques to learn from a large set of product
reviews.
